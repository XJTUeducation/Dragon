Dragon is a **C**(Computation)**G**(Graph)**V**(Virtual)**M**(Machine) based distributed deep learning framework.

Our goal is to reduce the unnecessary structures or interfaces. Therefore, in addition to feed or fetch, the last thing is designing a objective function through all available operators.

Besides, we demonstrate that a cross-frameworks frontend(**Deep Learning VirtualBox**) is feasible, and further more, will get benefit from all participating crucial interfaces especially when one is not reasonable.
